lists
-----------
a list can store multiple values in memory in Python.
a list looks like this: list = [1,2,3...]
a list can have special ops performed on it
values stored in a list are referenced from their position like list[0], list[1]...list[n]

list methods
------------

methods = built-in functions
list methods- are some action that can be applied to a list

immutable vs mutable
--------------------
variables are immutable meaning that whenever a new value is assigned to the same variable the previous value is blown away ex init = 1 ... init = 2 blows away 1 and replaces it with 2 this is called re-assignment 
lists are mutable meaning that elements can be changed in the list at any point in the code 
list not datatype specifc
